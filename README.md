# Sudoku_Solver

Stock puzzle used for both GUI and text versions is a basic example of an "X-wing" sudoku puzzle, though different puzzles can be hard-coded as one wishes. Pygame GUI version lets you click on cells, "pencil in" a number by typing, and finalize it by hitting enter. If it is part of the solution, it will stay, otherwise a strike will be added. At any time, hit space bar and the algorithm will solve it with visualization, though with more complex puzzles this can take some time due to the visualization; any solution in the text solver should be near instantaneous.
